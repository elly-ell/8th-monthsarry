        so hi baby, you're probably reading this paggising mo po, and idk what time ko 'to ma-send sayo. you might be thinking I forgot about it well, I haven't. I know I haven't been making much effort on our special days recently, and I'm really sorry about that. I've been thinking rin kasi... baka napre-pressure na kita when I'm doing a lot of things for you. actually, it's something I've been feeling since that drunk call mo sakin before. pero bahala na I just can't help it. I don't like it when I feel like hindi ko naipapakita love ko sayo. so here I am, bumabawi. writing this letter and singing for you, kasi you asked for it hshaha nahihiya na talaga ako, but bahala na basta para sayo baby :3, love u. (⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠)⁠♡

        <b>To my baby</b></p>

      <p>“hindi man araw-araw na nakangiti,<br>
        ilang beses na rin tayong humihindi…”</p>

<p>those lyrics hit different when I think about us. we’ve been through so much kahit na malayo tayo sa isat isa. there were days na we got quiet, had our tampo, or na misunderstood natin isa't isa. but at the end of the day, we always find our way back naman thankfully. we talk it out, say sorry, and remind each other na worth it tayo.
<br>
<br>kahit na we’re not physically together, you’ve made me feel so loved, so seen, and so understood baby. our late-night calls, our sleep calls where we fall asleep just hearing each other, our kisses over the phone those are the moments that make me feel loved.
<br>
<br>I love our quality time together, watch movies while on a call, how we play games and lambing lambing, and how just seeing your name on my screen can make me happy.
<br>
<br>we may not be beside each other, pero we’ve built something real. something strong. something na totoo.
<br>
<br>“’di man palaging masaya, tayo'y totoo…”
<br>that line says it all. we’re not perfect. but we’re honest, and we try. and I think that’s what matters most.
<br>
<br>thank you for choosing me every day, even when it’s hard. thank you for staying, for understanding, for loving me despite the distance and the rough days. you’re my peace, my comfort, and my home, even from far away.
<br>
<br>I’m proud of us. I’m proud of you. and I’ll keep choosing you, ashley. palagi..
<br>
<br>I love you. so much.
<br>here’s to more months of love, games, movie nights, kulitan, and call kisses.
<br>and one day real hugs. real kisses. real us.
<br>
<br><b>forever yours ell,
<br>palagi. :3</b>
